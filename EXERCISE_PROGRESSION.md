# Evidence-Based Exercise Progression Guide

**Research Source**: [Progressive Calisthenics Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466268/)
**Hypertrophy Evidence**: [Scientific Evidence Compilation](https://calisteniapp.com/articles/Compilation-of-ALL-Scientific-Evidence-on-Hypertrophy-training)

## Progressive Overload Strategy

### Rep Range: 6-20 Reps
- **Start**: 8 reps per set
- **Progress**: Add 1 rep each session
- **Plateau**: When hitting 20 reps on all sets → Increase difficulty
- **Evidence**: Practical benefit in 6-20 rep range for hypertrophy

### 4-Week Mesocycles
- **Weeks 1-4**: Foundation exercises
- **Weeks 5-8**: Intermediate variations
- **Weeks 9+**: Advanced progressions

---

## PUSH DAY PROGRESSIONS

### 1. Push-Up Progression
**Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**: Regular Push-Up
- Hands shoulder-width, lower chest to floor

**Intermediate (Weeks 5-8)**: Deficit Push-Up
- Hands on 6" blocks, lower chest BELOW hands
- Deeper range = more chest stretch

**Advanced (Weeks 9+)**: Pseudo-Planche Push-Up
- Hands by ribs, lean forward
- Shoulders past hands = extreme difficulty

### 2. Pike Push-Up Progression
**Foundation**: Pike Push-Up (floor)
- Hips high, lower head to floor

**Intermediate**: Feet Elevated Pike
- Feet on chair, steeper angle = more shoulder load

**Advanced**: Wall Handstand Push-Up
- Feet on wall, full handstand position
- Ultimate shoulder exercise

### 3. Tricep Extension Progression
**Foundation**: TRX Tricep Extension
- Standard angle, controlled tempo

**Intermediate**: Slow Tempo (3-1-1)
- 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up

**Advanced**: Feet Closer to Anchor
- Harder angle = more bodyweight load

---

## PULL DAY PROGRESSIONS

### 1. TRX Row Progression
**Foundation**: 45° Angle Row
- Body at 45°, comfortable angle

**Intermediate**: Horizontal Row
- Body fully horizontal = harder

**Advanced**: Feet Elevated Row
- Feet on chair, body horizontal
- Much greater load

### 2. Inverted Row Progression
**Foundation**: Feet On Ground
- Pull chest to handles

**Intermediate**: Feet Extended Further
- Harder angle increases difficulty

**Advanced**: Weighted (Backpack)
- Add 10-20 lbs progressively

---

## LEGS DAY PROGRESSIONS

### 1. Bulgarian Split Squat Progression
**Foundation**: Bodyweight
- Rear foot elevated, controlled tempo

**Intermediate**: Tempo (3-1-1)
- 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, explode up

**Advanced**: Weighted (Backpack)
- Add 10-20 lbs progressively

### 2. Pistol Squat Progression
**Foundation**: TRX Full Assist
- Hold TRX with both hands

**Intermediate**: Fingertip Assist
- Minimal support, building strength

**Advanced**: Full Pistol (No Assist)
- Elite single-leg strength

### 3. Hamstring Curl Progression
**Foundation**: Double Leg
- Both heels in TRX

**Intermediate**: Single Leg
- One heel in TRX, much harder

**Advanced**: Tempo + Pause
- 3 seconds out, 2 second pause, 1 second in

## Progression Timing

### When to Progress
✅ **Hit 20 reps on all sets** (3-4 sets) for 2 consecutive sessions
✅ **Exercise feels easy** at current difficulty
✅ **Form is perfect** (no compensation patterns)

### How to Progress
1. **Increase reps** (6 → 20 range)
2. **Slow tempo** (3-1-1: 3s eccentric, 1s pause, 1s concentric)
3. **Harder angle** (TRX: feet further out, body more horizontal)
4. **Add ROM** (deficit, elevated feet, deeper range)
5. **Add instability** (single limb, pause at bottom)
6. **Add weight** (backpack with books, weighted vest)

### Deload Weeks
Every 4-8 weeks, take a deload:
- Reduce volume by 50% (2 sets instead of 4)
- Same exercises, easier variations
- Recover, prevent overtraining
- Come back stronger

## Evidence-Based Principles

1. **Progressive Overload**: Must increase difficulty over time
2. **Specificity**: Train movement patterns, not isolated muscles
3. **Volume**: 6-8 hard sets per muscle per session
4. **Frequency**: 2x/week per muscle (PPL does this naturally)
5. **Recovery**: 48 hours between same muscle groups
6. **Periodization**: Vary difficulty every 4 weeks

## Sample 12-Week Plan

**Weeks 1-4** (Foundation)
- Regular push-ups: 3×8 → 3×20
- TRX rows 45°: 3×8 → 3×20
- Bulgarian split squats: 3×8 → 3×20

**Weeks 5-8** (Intermediate)
- Deficit push-ups: 4×8 → 4×20
- Horizontal TRX rows: 4×8 → 4×20
- Tempo split squats: 4×8 → 4×20

**Weeks 9-12** (Advanced)
- Pseudo-planche push-ups: 4×8 → 4×15
- Feet elevated rows: 4×8 → 4×15
- Weighted split squats: 4×8 → 4×15

## App Integration

The app automatically:
- Starts at 8 reps
- Increases target by 1 rep each session
- Shows "💪 PROGRESS!" notification at 20 reps
- Suggests harder variation

**You manually**:
- Choose harder exercise variation
- Adjust TRX angle/positioning
- Add tempo/pauses
- Add weight when needed

This keeps it simple while following evidence-based progression!
